Recommendation

Install Jira and ensure it is integrated with Prometheus to streamline issue tracking and monitoring. Integrating the ticketing system with an alerting and incident management solution, such as xMatters or Zenduty, can further reduce the toil in managing tickets.

Modify the alert settings for EndpointRegistrationTransientFailure to be disregarded unless they occur six times within an hour. Limit ticket creation for high rates of this alert to once weekly. Advanced ticketing systems like Jira Service Desk and OpsGenie are capable of prioritizing and handling recurring obsolete alerts efficiently.

Ignore alerts related to TooFewEndpointsRegistered, as they typically stem from an EndpointRegistrationFailure and do not require separate attention. This approach avoids unnecessary ticket clutter and focuses efforts on more critical alerts.

Establish protocols for creating tickets in response to critical issues such as EndpointRegistrationFailure, LLMBatchProcessingJobFailures, LLMModelStale, and LLMModelVeryStale, as well as scenarios where these issues occur simultaneously. Integrating the ticketing system with monitoring solutions enhances the ability to manage these significant alerts effectively.
